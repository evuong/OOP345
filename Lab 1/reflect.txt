• the difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code
• the execution effect of the code in the process() function that creates the String object
which is inserted into standard output (which member function(s) does this code call)
• the changes that you made in upgrading your String class.

1. Having 'initial' as an external linked variable lets it be accessed anywhere in the entire program. An internal linkage variable such as 'itemNumber' will only be accessible within the scope of the translation unit.

2. process has one function and it creates a new CString called 'a'. This string is initialized using the CString constructor and the string that is passed to it. It then outputs it to standard output.

3. To make the CString class manage any length of string, I changed strncpy to strcpy. I also deleted the line that null-terminates the last character in the string. This lets it copy any string length.
