1. the reason for the difference between the copy and move operations
2. the dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves
3. the changes you made in upgrading your w2 and Text modules

1. copy operators make a copy of one object to another object. move operators move ownership of all the member functions and data members to another object. this makes it take less resources and less time as indicated by the output. 
2. we used dynamic allocation of the addresses to the objects instead of objects because we wanted to use the address of the object and not just the object itself. 
3. I upgraded the Text modules to include a move constructor and move operator. I learned that move operators take less resources than copy constructors. I also learned about the chrono time objects and functions.
