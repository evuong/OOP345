• The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL.

Vectors are used in this assignment because they operate like arrays. Data can be pushed, read and accessed easily.

• Why there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code.

Because we are creating what we need as we need it. We are creating new objects that need to be accessed within the program.

• How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case.

Range-based for makes the code cleaner and easier to read. It is used so that it cannot go out of scope also.
