• The difference between the implementations of a functor and a lambda expression.

The implementation of a functor is written in a different file while it is being called in the main. The lambda expression is written on the spot, within the main.

studentList.display(std::cout, [](float grade) -> std::string {
            if (grade >= 90 && grade <= 100) {
                return "A+";
            }  ........


• A list of the exceptions that you have reported and the cases where you terminated texecution normally.

-terminations when it checks for number of arguments passed from command line
-terminations if catch is triggered after trying to createList


const T& operator[](size_t i) const {
            if (i > max_size) {
                throw "The index passed to the subscripting operator is out-of-bounds";
            }
            else {
                return list[i];
            }
        }

KVList(int n) {
            if (n > 0) {}
            else {
                throw "The number of elements received in the constructor is not positive-valued";
            }
